Enable Closed-Display Mode on your Mac Without Meeting Apple's Requirements.

Historically, keeping your Mac awake while in closed-display mode and not meeting [Apple's requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834) meant installing a [kernel extension](https://binaervarianz.de/projekte/programmieren/meltmac/), or running a [command](https://gist.github.com/pwnsdx/2ae98341e7e5e64d32b734b871614915) with elevated privileges. With the assistance of [Phil Dennis-Jordan](https://philjordan.eu/about), there's now a suprisingly simple way to do this without much fuss.
